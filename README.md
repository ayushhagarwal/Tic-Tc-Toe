# Tic-Tc-Toe
This is a very basic tic-tac-toe Python game developed using python and has applications of basic python loops keywords ,functions.
I have put up a jupyter notebook with the code
the code has each and every function sepaerately before being put together to get the game code.
I will be obliged if you go through the code use it and recommend me if any changes or modification which can be done to make the game better.
Also this is not completely a raw project I have made this with the help of my course on udemy COMPLETE PYTHON MASTERCLASS.
